    <h2>Choosing Your Crystals</h2>
    <p class="crystal-choosing">Whilst above we have shown you some of the most popular crystals for beginners, there are many,
         many differnt crystals to choose from. So how do we pick what crystals are best for us?  Many people struggle 
         with this question, and that is OK! There are a lot of things to think about. It is best to choose a personal 
         power gem based on your current needs. It is important to be in the moment when choosing a gemstone, because what
          was right for your energy five years ago, is not necessarily what you need right now! </p>
          <p class="crystal-choosing">Sometimes it is just not easy to know or feel exactly what you need. Many people go through periods where they are
               overwhelmed, stressed, overstimulated, or just a bit lost. These are times when it can be a bit difficult, or even 
               frustrating to try and think about your needs. Feeling like this makes it hard to know how to choose a crystal, but
                luckily there are other spiritual practices that can help you to find some answers. It is great if one 
                of these practices helps you immediately identify your needs, but otherwise take it slow and start
                 by crossing off things that do not feel right. Great ways to do this are with:</p>
