    <div class="flex-item" id="flex-item-2"> <h2>Reiki Healing</h2> <p>Reiki is a spiritual healing art which is Japanese origin.
         The word Reiki comes from the Japanese word (Rei) which means “Universal Life” and (Ki) which means 
         “Energy”. Reiki is not affiliated with any particular religion or religious practice. It is not massage
          nor is it based on belief or suggestion. It is a subtle and effective form of energy work using
           spiritually guided life force energy.

       <p> Reiki is the life energy that flows through all living things. Reiki Practitioners 
       understand that everyone has the ability to connect with their own healing energy and use it to 
      strengthen energy in themselves and help others. It is believed that a persons “ki” or energy should
       be strong and free-flowing. When this is true, a persons body and mind is in a positive state of 
       health. When the energy becomes weak or blocked it could lead to symptoms of physical or emotional
     imbalance.</p>
        
       <p> A Reiki session can help ease tension and stress and can help support the body to facilitate an 
        environment for healing on all levels; physical, mental, and emotional. A session is pleasant and 
        relaxing and is often utilized for ones personal wellness.</p>
        
       <h2> History of Reiki</h2>
        <p>Reiki is believed to have been associated with Mikao Usui who is credited with rediscovering the 
        root system now called Reiki. His tradition and methods were passed through several grandmasters of
         Reiki. Today, Reiki takes many forms, however, The Usui System of Natural Healing is still the form
          most widely practiced. Practitioners and Master Teachers are trained through an initiation process 
          where Masters pass on their knowledge and expertise to their students.</p> </div>
