            <h3>Amethyst</h3>
            <P>This powerful calming stone is wonderful for individuals who suffer from anxiety or mood swings.
                This purple hue crystal radiates tranquilizing energy that dispels anger, fear, and worry.

            <h3>Citrine</h3>

                know
                what you are buying, as the more common Amethyst is often sold in place of natural Citrine.
                Citrine is often used for raising self-esteem and is believed to be helpful for overcoming depression,
                anxiety and phobias.</p>

        <h2>Choosing Your Crystals</h2>
        <p class="crystal-choosing">Whilst above we have shown you some of the most popular crystals for beginners,
            there are many,
            many differnt crystals to choose from. So how do we pick what crystals are best for us? Many people struggle
            with this question, and that is OK! There are a lot of things to think about. It is best to choose a
            personal
            power gem based on your current needs. It is important to be in the moment when choosing a gemstone, because
            what
            was right for your energy five years ago, is not necessarily what you need right now! </p>
        <p class="crystal-choosing">Sometimes it is just not easy to know or feel exactly what you need. Many people go
            through periods where they are
            overwhelmed, stressed, overstimulated, or just a bit lost. These are times when it can be a bit difficult,
            or even
            frustrating to try and think about your needs. Feeling like this makes it hard to know how to choose a
            crystal, but
            luckily there are other spiritual practices that can help you to find some answers. It is great if one
            of these practices helps you immediately identify your needs, but otherwise take it slow and start
            by crossing off things that do not feel right. Great ways to do this are with:</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Astrology, Chakras, Tarot Cards, Pendulums, Visualization.</strong></p>

        <p>“In a Crystal we have clear evidence of the existence of a formative life principle, and although we cannot
            understand the life of a Crystal,
            it is nonetheless a living being.” - Nicolas Tesla</p>
